  ## Developer Experience is more than just Productivity metrics
  With everything changing in tech at a frenetic pace, the emphasis on developer productivity has overshadowed the true essence of developer experience (DevEx). While frameworks like SPACE, getDX, and DORA metrics provide valuable insights, they often miss the mark on capturing developers' real, day-to-day experiences using tools and services, instead focusing strictly on the bottom line for the company. Meanwhile, developers and practitioners are job-hopping more than ever.
  This talk will explore the origins and evolution of "developer experience," dissect popular frameworks, and advocate for a more balanced approach that values the practitioner's perspective. At the end we will set a path towards integrating top-down metrics with bottom-up feedback, ensuring an approach to developer experience that fosters innovation and satisfaction.
